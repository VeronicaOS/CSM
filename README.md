For this project I had to make a webpage for a fictional Comunity Science Museum located in my town - a website where you will find all the information needed to learn more about the museum and it's exhibits, find the location, opening hours and more.

## Description

This was the first big project at Noroff - semester project 1. We were tasked to design it first in Figma, and then build a website for it using only HTML and CSS. This made some parts of the assigment more tricky, but it also meant I learned a lot though this process. 

## Brief

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. The museum wants an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent.

### Target audience
Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

### Site architecture
- Home
